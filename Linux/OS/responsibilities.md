- Processor (and Processes) Management
- Memory Management
- Input/Output Devices Management
- File System Management
- Security Management (user space/scopes, permissions, passwords, firewall)

## Processor (CPU) Management (Hardware resource)
- **CPU scheduling**: The OS uses various scheduling algorithms (e.g., Round Robin, Priority Scheduling) to decide which process should get CPU time at any given moment.
- **Context switching**: When switching between processes, the OS saves the current process’s state and loads the next one’s state. This allows multiple processes to share the CPU.
- **Handling multiple CPUs**: In systems with multiple processors or cores, the OS allocates tasks across them to balance the load, improving performance and efficiency.
- **Managing CPU affinity and priorities**: The OS may assign certain processes to specific CPU cores to optimize performance, especially in multi-core systems.

## Processes Management (Software units)
- **Creating processes**: When you start a program, the OS creates a new process and allocates necessary resources like memory and file handles.
- **Managing process states**: Processes go through various states (e.g., running, waiting, terminated), and the OS tracks and manages these states.
- **Synchronizing processes**: When multiple processes need to interact (like sharing data), the OS ensures they are properly synchronized to prevent race conditions or deadlocks.
- **Terminating processes**: Once a process completes its task or needs to be closed, the OS deallocates its resources and removes it from the system.

### Key Differences:
| **Aspect**               | **Process Management**                                   | **Processor Management**                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                 | Managing individual processes and their execution        | Managing how the CPU is allocated to processes           |
| **Main Concern**          | The lifecycle, states, and resource allocation of processes| Efficient CPU utilization and task scheduling            |
| **Examples of Tasks**     | Process creation, termination, IPC, synchronization      | CPU scheduling, context switching, load balancing        |
| **Resource Managed**      | Processes (software units)                              | Processor (hardware resource)                            |

### Relationship Between the Two:
While **process management** and **processor management** are distinct, they are closely linked:
- **Process management** ensures that processes are created, managed, and terminated effectively, while **processor management** ensures that the CPU is shared among these processes in a fair and efficient manner.
- When the OS manages processes, it needs the CPU to run them. The OS schedules the CPU (processor management) to execute processes (process management).
- Both are essential for **multitasking** and **multiprocessing** environments, where multiple processes are running concurrently and need to share the CPU without conflicts.

### Conclusion:
While **process management** and **processor management** both deal with running programs on a computer, they focus on different levels of the system:
- **Process management** handles the software side of things—managing the individual programs (processes) that are running on the system.
- **Processor management** focuses on the hardware side—deciding how the physical CPU is shared among the processes.
