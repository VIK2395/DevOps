# Installed (via an installer or wizard) applications vs Portable applications (Windows OS context)

The difference between Installed and Portable Applications applications.

### 1. **Installed Applications**
These applications typically require an installation process for several reasons:
- **System Integration**: They need to integrate with the operating system by modifying system files or registry entries. This can include setting up dependencies like .DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries), adding environment variables, or associating file types with the application.
- **User-specific configurations**: Some applications need to store settings or user-specific data in system folders like the `AppData` folder on Windows. The installer ensures these directories are set up correctly.
- **Dependencies**: They may rely on external libraries or frameworks (such as the .NET framework, Visual C++ redistributables, etc.) that need to be installed separately or alongside the app. The installation wizard handles these dependencies.
- **Services**: Some applications need to run background services, which require system-level privileges and proper installation to function.
- **Security**: By installing the software via a wizard, the program can ensure that it's properly placed in a secured directory (like `Program Files`), which helps protect against unauthorized modification or malicious software interference.

### 2. **Portable Applications**
These are applications that do not require an installation process and can run directly from an executable file. They have certain characteristics:
- **Self-contained**: Portable apps come bundled with everything they need to run, without requiring installation of external libraries or system modifications. All files and settings are stored in the app's directory.
- **Minimal system integration**: Portable apps don't modify system settings or the registry, making them easier to remove and often safer to use on shared or limited-privilege systems.
- **Flexibility**: These apps can be stored on external devices like USB drives and run on different machines without leaving a trace on the host system.
- **No user-specific settings stored**: Since these applications donâ€™t usually store settings outside their directory, user data remains portable with the app itself, but this may limit certain features that require deeper system integration.

### Why the Difference?
- **Complexity of the Application**: Complex applications with many dependencies, background services, or deep integration into the system (like Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop) usually require installation wizards to set everything up properly.
- **Portability**: Applications designed to be easily moved between machines or that have minimal system requirements (like media players or basic utilities) can often be made portable.
- **Security and Licensing**: Some software requires an installation to enforce licensing or DRM (Digital Rights Management), as the installer can ensure proper license validation and secure the software against tampering.

In summary, applications that need to modify the system or interact deeply with the OS tend to require installation wizards, while simpler, more self-contained applications can run directly without installation.

# How installers work

Installers are specialized programs that automate the process of setting up software on a computer by handling several tasks, such as copying files, configuring settings, and ensuring that all necessary components and dependencies are in place. Here's a breakdown of how installers work:

### 1. **Initialization**
   When you launch an installer (typically by running an `.exe`, `.msi`, or `.pkg` file), the first step is initialization:
   - **System check**: The installer checks the system environment to ensure it meets the minimum requirements for the software, such as the operating system version, hardware capabilities, available disk space, and required libraries.
   - **Dependency check**: It verifies whether any external components (such as frameworks, drivers, or libraries) are already present or need to be installed.
   - **Permissions check**: If the installation requires system-level changes (e.g., writing to protected directories or modifying the registry), the installer will prompt for administrative privileges.

### 2. **Unpacking Files**
   Installers typically come as compressed or packaged files. Once initialized, they start the process of unpacking or extracting these files:
   - **Decompression**: The installer unpacks the application's files from a compressed archive to the target directory (usually `C:\Program Files` on Windows or `/Applications` on macOS).
   - **Copying files**: It copies all necessary files (executables, libraries, media, etc.) to their appropriate locations on the disk.

### 3. **Setting Up Dependencies**
   If the software depends on other libraries, frameworks, or services, the installer ensures they are present and properly configured:
   - **Installing missing dependencies**: Common dependencies include frameworks like the .NET Framework, Java, or Visual C++ Redistributable Packages.
   - **Registering DLLs**: In the case of Windows applications, some installers register DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files with the operating system so that other applications can use them.
   - **Database or service setup**: For server or enterprise software, the installer may set up a database, configure user permissions, or install background services.

### 4. **Configuration and System Integration**
   After unpacking the files, the installer typically configures settings that integrate the software with the operating system:
   - **Registry updates (Windows)**: The installer may add entries to the Windows Registry, storing configuration information such as file associations, settings, and program paths.
   - **Environment variables**: Some programs require environment variables to be set so the operating system knows where to find the application's files.
   - **Shortcuts**: The installer often creates shortcuts on the desktop, Start menu, or other locations for quick access to the program.
   - **File associations**: The installer may associate certain file types (e.g., `.docx` for Word) with the application, so double-clicking these files automatically opens the software.

### 5. **User Input (During Installation)**
   In some cases, the installer will require user interaction to customize the setup:
   - **Installation path**: The user may be prompted to choose where to install the software (e.g., default directories vs. custom paths).
   - **Feature selection**: Many installers allow users to select which features or components they want to install. For example, a graphics software installer might allow users to choose whether to install plug-ins or additional tools.
   - **License agreement**: Users often need to agree to the terms of a license agreement before the installation can proceed.

### 6. **Post-installation Configuration**
   Once the core installation is complete, some software may require additional setup or configuration:
   - **User settings**: The software might prompt the user to configure initial settings or preferences, such as language, themes, or update preferences.
   - **Database setup**: Enterprise software might initialize databases or configure backend services during this stage.
   - **Driver installation**: If the software requires specific drivers (e.g., for peripherals like printers or graphics cards), the installer might install and configure those drivers.

### 7. **Finalization and Cleanup**
   Once the installation process is complete, the installer performs final tasks to ensure everything is set up correctly:
   - **Verification**: Some installers perform checks to ensure that all files were correctly copied and configured.
   - **Creating logs**: The installer might create a log file that records all actions taken during the installation, which can help in troubleshooting.
   - **Cleaning up**: Temporary files or extraction archives used during the installation are deleted to free up space.
   - **Prompting for reboot**: In some cases (especially for system drivers or deep system integration), the installer may prompt the user to reboot the system to apply changes.

### 8. **Uninstallation Support**
   During the installation, the installer typically prepares an **uninstaller** that will allow the user to remove the software later:
   - **Storing uninstaller**: The uninstaller is usually placed in the same directory as the installed application or in a system folder like "Programs and Features" on Windows.
   - **Tracking installed files**: The installer keeps track of the files, folders, and registry entries it added, so it knows what to remove during uninstallation.
   - **Creating restore points**: In some cases, the installer may create system restore points, so the system can be reverted to its previous state if something goes wrong during installation.

### Installer Types
- **Native Installers (e.g., .exe, .msi)**: These are specific to an operating system. On Windows, `.msi` (Microsoft Installer) is a common format for managing installations and uninstalls.
- **Cross-Platform Installers (e.g., InstallShield, NSIS)**: Some installers can work across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) by using tools like InstallShield or NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System).
- **Package Managers**: On Linux and macOS, software is often installed via package managers (e.g., `apt` for Debian-based systems or `brew` on macOS), which handle software installations and updates automatically by resolving dependencies and fetching packages from repositories.

### In Summary
Installers automate the process of copying files, configuring dependencies, integrating software with the operating system, and setting up user preferences. They manage system changes to ensure the software runs properly and provide uninstallers for easy removal. They also play a critical role in ensuring that all necessary components are in place for the software to function correctly.

#  How installers work on different operating systems

### 1. **Windows**
   - **Installer Types**: Common formats include `.exe` (executable files), `.msi` (Microsoft Installer), and `.bat` (batch files).
   - **Installation Process**: Most software in Windows uses standalone installers (like the installation wizards we discussed), which guide the user through the installation process. These installers often modify the registry, install dependencies (like libraries or frameworks), and create system shortcuts.
   - **Package Managers**: Recently, Windows has introduced package management systems like **Windows Package Manager (winget)**, which works similarly to Linux package managers, enabling users to install software via the command line.

### 2. **macOS**
   macOS has several ways to install software:
   - **DMG Files**: Most macOS applications are distributed as `.dmg` (Disk Image) files. The user typically:
     1. Downloads the `.dmg` file.
     2. Mounts it by double-clicking it.
     3. Drags the app (e.g., `.app` file) to the `/Applications` folder to "install" it.
     4. Unmounts and deletes the `.dmg` file.
     This process is much simpler than in Windows, as itâ€™s essentially just copying the application file to a directory, and no system-wide changes (like registry modifications) are typically needed.
   - **Package Files (.pkg)**: Some more complex applications on macOS use `.pkg` files, which work more like traditional installers. They walk the user through a guided installation process and can install system libraries, modify permissions, or configure background services.
   - **Homebrew (Package Manager)**: macOS also has **Homebrew**, a command-line package manager similar to those found on Linux. Homebrew allows users to install software by running a simple command, which resolves dependencies, downloads the necessary files, and installs them.
   - **Mac App Store**: Software can also be installed directly from the Mac App Store, which simplifies the installation process and manages updates automatically.

### 3. **Linux**
   Linux distributions handle software installation in several ways, with **package managers** being the most common method. Each Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch) typically uses its own package manager, which automates the process of downloading, installing, and updating software from official repositories.

   - **Package Managers**: Linux software is usually installed through package managers, such as:
     - **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**: Used by Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu. It installs `.deb` packages.
     - **YUM or DNF**: Used by Red Hat-based distributions like Fedora. It installs `.rpm` packages.
     - **Pacman**: Used by Arch Linux.
     These tools handle the installation of software packages, including dependency management, downloading the latest version, and verifying the integrity of the software.
   - **Installation Commands**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install <package_name>  # For Debian-based distros
     sudo dnf install <package_name>  # For Fedora-based distros
     sudo pacman -S <package_name>    # For Arch-based distros
     ```
   - **Flatpak/Snap/AppImage**: These are universal packaging formats that aim to make software distribution more cross-platform and isolated from the system.
     - **Snap** (by Canonical) and **Flatpak** are used to create self-contained apps with all their dependencies, making them easier to install across different Linux distributions.
     - **AppImage**: Works similarly to macOS `.dmg` files, allowing the user to download and run the application without installation or system changes. Itâ€™s essentially a portable app for Linux.

### Key Differences Across Platforms:
- **Windows**: Primarily uses standalone installers like `.exe` or `.msi` that modify the system (e.g., registry) and often require installation wizards. Windows now has package managers (like `winget`) but they are relatively new.
- **macOS**: Uses `.dmg` for simple drag-and-drop installations, or `.pkg` for more complex installations. Package managers like Homebrew and the Mac App Store also provide alternative ways to install software.
- **Linux**: Strongly package-manager-centric (APT, YUM, Pacman), with installation commands that automatically handle dependencies. Universal formats like Snap and Flatpak are also common for easier cross-distribution software management.

### Conclusion:
While the approach and file formats differ between operating systems, installers (or their equivalents) exist on all platformsâ€”Windows, macOS, and Linux. Each platform has its own conventions, with Linux leaning more heavily on package managers and repositories, macOS using a mix of package-based installations and drag-and-drop app installations, and Windows relying primarily on standalone installers and wizards.
