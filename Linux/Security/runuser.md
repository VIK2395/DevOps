The `runuser` command in Linux allows you to run commands as another user without requiring the root user to enter the target userâ€™s password. It is similar to su, but typically used in scripts and systemd services because it does not prompt for a password.

# But it is not secure if I can ran command from another user?

Yes, allowing unrestricted use of the `runuser` command could indeed be a security risk if not properly controlled. However, **`runuser` is generally restricted to the root user**, which mitigates the security concern. Let's break down why it's not insecure under typical circumstances and how to keep it secure:

### Why `runuser` is Usually Secure:

1. **`runuser` Can Be Used Only by `root`:**
   - The `runuser` command is designed to be used only by the `root` user. Non-root users cannot execute `runuser` to switch to another user without having root privileges.
   - This means that only the system administrator (root) can run commands as another user, and ordinary users cannot misuse it.

2. **Controlled Access by `sudo` and Permissions:**
   - Typically, access to `root` privileges is controlled by `sudo`. Non-root users need to be granted specific permissions in the `/etc/sudoers` file to use `sudo` to run commands as another user.
   - **Even if you allow certain users to execute specific commands with `sudo`, you can limit what commands they can run, preventing misuse.**

### Conclusion:
The `runuser` command is secure as long as it's restricted to the **root** user or users with carefully configured **sudo** permissions. It's important to control access to `runuser` (or commands like `sudo` that can invoke it) by ensuring that only trusted users can execute commands as other users.
