# Directory vs file permissions

### Directory Permissions (`rwxr-xr-x` for `/home/username`):
- **Read (r)**: The ability to list the files and subdirectories inside the directory (i.e., run `ls` to see filenames).
- **Write (w)**: The ability to create, delete, or rename files inside the directory.
- **Execute (x)**: The ability to access (or "enter") the directory and navigate to files or subdirectories inside it.

### File Permissions (`rwxr-xr-x` for a file):
- **Read (r)**: The ability to view or read the contents of the file (i.e., run `cat`, `less`, or open it in a text editor).
- **Write (w)**: The ability to modify the file, such as editing, appending, or deleting its contents.
- **Execute (x)**: The ability to run the file as a program or script (only applicable to executable files like shell scripts or binaries).
