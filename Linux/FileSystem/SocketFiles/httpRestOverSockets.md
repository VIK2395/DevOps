# Can we perform http request via Unix sockets?

It's possible to perform **HTTP-like** requests via Unix sockets, but the process is a bit different compared to traditional HTTP requests over a network.

### Unix Socket vs. Network Socket

- **Unix Sockets**: A **Unix socket** is a way for processes to communicate with each other on the same machine (inter-process communication, IPC). It's a file-based communication mechanism that allows processes to send and receive data through a special file, typically located in the file system (e.g., `/var/run/docker.sock`).
  
- **Network Sockets**: A **network socket** is typically used for communication over a network (TCP/IP, UDP, etc.). HTTP requests are commonly sent over TCP sockets to communicate with web servers, like sending a request to `http://example.com`.

### How Docker Uses Unix Sockets for REST API Requests

Docker uses Unix sockets for communication between the Docker CLI and the Docker daemon, instead of using a regular HTTP server that listens on a network socket (like port 80 or 443).

1. **Docker Daemon**: The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) listens for commands from the Docker CLI via a Unix socket. The default socket for Docker is `/var/run/docker.sock`. This socket file represents the endpoint where the Docker daemon accepts requests.
  
2. **Docker CLI**: When you run a command like `docker ps`, the Docker CLI sends an **HTTP-like** request to the Docker daemon via the Unix socket. Technically, it’s not using the standard HTTP protocol over TCP/IP but mimicking the HTTP request format to interact with the Docker API.

3. **Request Format**: Even though the communication happens over a Unix socket, it still uses an HTTP-style request format because Docker's API is designed like a REST API, with endpoints resembling HTTP methods:
   - **GET**: For retrieving data, like `docker ps` (to list containers).
   - **POST**: For creating or modifying resources, such as `docker run` (to start a container).
   - **DELETE**: For removing resources, such as `docker rm` (to remove a container).
   - **PUT**: For updating or replacing resources.

### Example of Communication via Unix Socket

- **Docker Daemon**: It exposes an API via the Unix socket at `/var/run/docker.sock`. This socket behaves like a server, waiting for requests.
  
- **Docker CLI**: When you run a command like `docker ps`, the CLI constructs an HTTP-style request (e.g., `GET /containers/json`) and sends it to the Docker daemon through the Unix socket.

For example, the Docker CLI would internally send something like this:
```plaintext
GET /containers/json HTTP/1.1
Host: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

This is similar to how a web server processes HTTP requests, but instead of communicating over TCP/IP (like `http://localhost:8080`), the request goes through the local Unix socket file `/var/run/docker.sock`.

### Using HTTP Requests Over Unix Sockets

Even though the Docker API is structured like HTTP, tools like `curl` can be used to interact with it via Unix sockets. For example, to interact with Docker’s API using `curl`, you would do something like this:

```bash
curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock -X GET http://localhost/containers/json
```

Here’s what happens:
- `--unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock`: This tells `curl` to communicate via the Unix socket instead of the default network.
- `http://localhost/containers/json`: This is the API endpoint, which looks like an HTTP URL, but it actually goes through the Unix socket, not a network connection.

### Why Use Unix Sockets Instead of HTTP?

- **Efficiency**: Unix sockets are often faster and more efficient than network sockets for communication between local processes. There’s no need for network stack overhead, which makes Unix sockets ideal for local inter-process communication.
  
- **Security**: Unix sockets can provide better security for local communication. By restricting access to the socket file (e.g., only allowing the Docker user), you can control which processes are able to interact with the Docker daemon, making it more secure than opening up a TCP port for external access.

- **Simplicity**: Docker doesn’t need to run an HTTP server on a specific port (like port 2375 for the Docker remote API over HTTP). The communication through the Unix socket simplifies things, especially since Docker is often used in a local, single-machine context.

### Conclusion

HTTP-like requests can be sent over Unix sockets. In Docker’s case, it mimics the HTTP request structure (GET, POST, etc.) for its REST API, but the requests are sent via the Unix socket (typically `/var/run/docker.sock`). This provides a fast, efficient, and secure method for local communication between the Docker CLI and the Docker daemon.

# What does 'mimics' mean?

The word **"mimics"** means to imitate or replicate the appearance, behavior, or actions of something. In the context of the previous explanation, when I say that Docker "mimics" HTTP requests, I mean that Docker’s API follows the structure and behavior of an HTTP request, but it doesn't necessarily use the actual HTTP protocol over the network.

### Breaking it down:
- **Mimic**: To resemble, copy, or act like something else.
  
- In the case of Docker and Unix sockets:
  - The Docker daemon uses a communication format that resembles HTTP (e.g., it uses "GET", "POST", "DELETE" methods) to handle requests.
  - However, this communication is done **locally** via Unix sockets (like `/var/run/docker.sock`), not over a network using the HTTP protocol.

### Example:
- **HTTP**: A typical web request might be:
  ```http
  GET /api/containers
  ```
  This is a request sent over TCP/IP using the HTTP protocol.
  
- **Docker over Unix Socket**: A similar request to the Docker daemon might be:
  ```http
  GET /containers/json
  ```
  Even though the request looks like an HTTP request, it's actually transmitted over a Unix socket, not the typical HTTP network protocol.

So, when I say "mimics HTTP", I mean that Docker uses a format and style similar to HTTP requests, but it doesn't technically use the HTTP protocol over a network. It's just a convention that makes it easier for users and developers to interact with Docker's REST API in a familiar way.
