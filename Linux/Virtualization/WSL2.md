# Is WSL2 a hypervisor?

**WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)** uses a **Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisor** to run a full Linux kernel on Windows, **but** WSL2 itself is not a hypervisor. Instead, it leverages the **Hyper-V** hypervisor, which is built into Windows, to create a lightweight virtual machine where the Linux kernel can run.

Here’s how WSL2 works in relation to hypervisors:

### Key Points about WSL2 and Hyper-V:

1. **Hyper-V Integration**:
   - WSL2 relies on Microsoft's **Hyper-V** technology, a Type 1 hypervisor, to run a virtualized Linux kernel. However, unlike traditional Hyper-V virtual machines, WSL2 is optimized to be lightweight and offers near-native performance by tightly integrating with the Windows operating system.

2. **Full Linux Kernel**:
   - Unlike WSL1, which translated Linux system calls into Windows system calls, WSL2 runs a full Linux kernel inside a virtual machine. This approach provides full system call compatibility and better performance, especially for file I/O, networking, and running Docker containers.

3. **Virtual Machine (VM) Architecture**:
   - While WSL2 uses a virtual machine under the hood, it is not a full-blown, standalone VM like traditional Hyper-V VMs. It is designed to be more resource-efficient, with the ability to start and stop quickly, and it doesn’t require users to manage a separate VM instance.

4. **Seamless Integration with Windows**:
   - One of WSL2’s strengths is its ability to tightly integrate with Windows. You can run Linux applications and tools side by side with Windows apps, and they can interact with each other (e.g., accessing the same file system or network interfaces).

5. **Use of Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)**:
   - WSL2 leverages **Virtualization-Based Security** features of Windows, where Hyper-V is used to isolate processes and create secure execution environments.

### How WSL2 Differs from Traditional Hypervisors:
- **Purpose**: WSL2 is not a traditional hypervisor like Hyper-V, VMware, or VirtualBox. Its purpose is to run Linux applications natively on Windows in a highly integrated and lightweight way, rather than to manage full virtual machines.
- **No Full VM Management**: Users don’t interact with WSL2 as they would with a virtual machine. They interact with a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian) installed via WSL2, which is abstracted from the underlying hypervisor.
- **Lightweight Virtualization**: WSL2 is designed to be much lighter than a standard virtual machine, with less overhead and better resource sharing between Linux and Windows environments.

### In Summary:
While WSL2 uses **Hyper-V**, a Type 1 hypervisor, for virtualization, WSL2 itself is not a hypervisor. It is more of an optimized environment that allows Windows users to run a full Linux kernel in a lightweight, virtualized space provided by Hyper-V.

# Is WSL2 bare-metal or hosted?

**WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) is considered a **hosted hypervisor**, meaning it operates in a **Type 2** virtualization model. Here’s why:

### WSL 2 Overview:
- **WSL 2** allows you to run a full Linux kernel on Windows, but instead of using a simple compatibility layer like WSL 1, WSL 2 uses **virtualization** to run a real Linux kernel in a lightweight virtual machine (VM).
  
### Why WSL 2 is Hosted (Type 2 Hypervisor):
1. **Runs on Top of Windows**:
   - WSL 2 operates **within** the Windows operating system, not directly on the hardware. This makes it a **Type 2 hypervisor** because it requires the **Windows kernel** to be running underneath, and it does not directly manage the hardware itself.
  
2. **Uses Hyper-V for Virtualization**:
   - WSL 2 runs the Linux kernel inside a lightweight virtual machine using **Hyper-V** technology, which is a **Type 1 hypervisor** (bare-metal). However, since WSL 2 itself runs within the Windows environment, it is not considered a bare-metal solution. It uses **Windows' hosted hypervisor capabilities** to manage the Linux VM.
  
3. **Shared Resources**:
   - Since WSL 2 runs inside Windows, it shares the resources managed by Windows (e.g., CPU, memory, file systems) and interacts with the Windows OS rather than directly with the hardware, a typical characteristic of a **hosted** virtualization environment.

### Difference Between WSL 2 and Bare-Metal Hypervisors:
- In a **bare-metal hypervisor** (like Hyper-V or VMware ESXi), the hypervisor controls the hardware directly, and guest operating systems (like Linux or Windows VMs) run directly on top of it.
- In the case of **WSL 2**, the Linux kernel runs in a virtualized environment inside the **Windows host**, so it doesn’t have direct control over hardware like a bare-metal hypervisor would.

### Summary:
**WSL 2** is a **hosted environment** (Type 2 hypervisor) because it relies on **Windows** as the host operating system and uses **Hyper-V** technology to run Linux in a virtualized environment. While it uses **Hyper-V**, which is a bare-metal hypervisor, WSL 2 itself is not bare-metal, as it operates **within** the Windows host.
